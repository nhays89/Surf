## Problem
Now that you’ve come to Florida and taken up surfing, you love it! Of course, you’ve realized that
if you take a particular wave, even if it’s very fun, you may miss another wave that’s just about
to come that’s even more fun. Luckily, you’ve gotten excellent data for each wave that is going to
come: you’ll know exactly when it will come, how many fun points you’ll earn if you take it, and
how much time you’ll have to wait before taking another wave. (The wait is due to the fact that
the wave itself takes some time to ride and then you have to paddle back out to where the waves
are crashing.) Obviously, given a list of waves, your goal will be to maximize the amount of fun
you could have.
Consider, for example, the following list of waves:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Minute</th>
    <th align="left">Fun Points</th>
    <th align="left">Wait Time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<section> In this example, you could take the waves at times 8, 10 and 13 for a total of 110 fun points. If
you take the wave at time 2, you can’t ride another wave until time 11, at which point only 20 fun
points are left for the wave at time 13, leaving you with a total of 100 fun points. Thus, for this
input, the correct answer (maximal number of fun points) is 110.
<br>Given a complete listing of waves for the day, determine the maximum number of fun points
you could earn.
</section>

### Input
___
The first line of input contains a single integer <em>n</em> (1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 300,000), representing the total number
of waves for the day. The <em>i</em>th line (1 ≤ <em>i</em> ≤<em> n</em>) that follows will contain three space separated
integers: <em> m<sub>i</sub></em>,<em> f<sub>i</sub></em>, and <em>w<sub>i</sub></em>, (1 ≤<em> m<sub>i</sub></em>,<em> f<sub>i</sub></em>, <em>w<sub>i</sub></em> ≤ 106), representing the time, fun points, and wait time
of the <em>i</em>th wave, respectively. You can ride another wave occurring at exactly time <em>m<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>w<sub>i</sub></em> after
taking the <em>i</em>th wave. It is guaranteed that no two waves occur at the same time. The waves may
not be listed in chronological order

### Output
___
Print, on a single line, a single integer indicating the maximum amount of fun points you can get
riding waves.

## Solution

The key to solving this problem in a short period of time is to leverage principles of dynamic programming, and make use of efficient data structures. 
### Approach
____
At first glance, the problem structure resembles [group interval scheduling maximization problem (GISMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_scheduling). 
In these types of problems, the goal is to find the largest compatible set — a set of non-overlapping representatives of maximum size. In this scenario, a set of non-overlapping waves that produce the combined maximum points. It would seem as though to solve this problem one would store the maximums for each period of time up to the last waves start time, but this is not the case—at least in this implementation. Instead, maximums are stored for each new wave. There are two maximums of interest: <em>actual</em> and <em>real</em>. The <em>actual</em> maximum represents the highest accumulated point total for this wave and all subsequent non-overlapping waves that come before it assuming this wave is actually a member of the set. The <em>real</em> maximum represents the highest accumulated point total amongst all possible non-overlapping combinations of waves up to this wave regardless if this wave is included in the set of waves. Therefore, the <em>real</em> maximum for a particular wave may not include the wave as part of the total if there is a higher maximum total that can be achieved without it. 

### General Idea
___

The algorithm we choose to implement goes something like this:
<ol>
  <li>For each line in the input data:
    <ol>
      <li> Create a wave object (start time, fun points, and duration).</li>
      <li> Add this wave to an ArrayList of wave's.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Sort the ArrayList by the wave's start time (when the wave crashes).</li>
  <li>For each wave in the list:
    <ol>
      <li>Add this wave to a Priority Heap (lowest end time first).</li>
      <li>For each wave in the heap that ends (start time + duration) before this wave begins (non overlapping):
        <ol>
          <li>Remove it from the heap.</li>
          <li>Compare its <em>actual</em> max against the local <em>actual</em> max.</li>
          <li>If its <em>acutal</em> max > local <em>actual</em> max ? update local <em>actual</em> max : continue</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Set the global <em>actual</em> max = local <em>actual</em> max</li>
      <li>Set this wave's <em>actual</em> max = its fun points + global <em>actual</em> max.</li>
      <li>If this wave's <em>actual</em> max  > previous wave <em>real</em> max ? set this wave <em>real</em> max = its <em>actual</em> max :set this wave's <em>real</em> max = previous waves <em>real</em> max.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Return the last wave's <em>real</em> max.</li>
</ol>
